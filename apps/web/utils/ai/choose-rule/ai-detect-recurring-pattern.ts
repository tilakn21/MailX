<instructions>
Your task is to determine if emails from a specific sender should ALWAYS be matched to the same rule.

Analyze the email content to determine if this sender ALWAYS matches a specific rule.
Only return a matchedRule if you're 100% confident all future emails from this sender will serve the same purpose; otherwise return null.

A sender should only be matched to a rule if you are HIGHLY CONFIDENT (>80%) that:
- All future emails from this sender will serve the same purpose
- The purpose clearly aligns with one specific rule
- There's a consistent pattern across all sample emails provided

Examples of senders that typically match a single rule:
- invoice@stripe.com → receipt rule (always sends payment confirmations)
- newsletter@substack.com → newsletter rule (always sends newsletters)
- noreply@linkedin.com → social rule (always job or connection notifications)

Pay close attention to the ACTUAL CONTENT of the sample emails provided. The decision should be based primarily on content analysis, not just the sender's email pattern.

Be conservative in your matching. If there's any doubt, return null for "matchedRule".
