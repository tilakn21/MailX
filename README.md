# Kriyeta 4.0 | Mail X

- **Problem Statement**: Create a reusable platform using Agentic AI where agents collaboratively classify incoming emails (mock or real), extract action items, assign them to categories (e.g., meetings, follow-ups, approvals), and generate suggested responses or summaries. Useful for overloaded professionals and internal use.
- **Expected Outcome**: An end-to-end email triage assistant that tags, summarizes, and drafts replies via interacting agents.

## WHY THIS PROBLEM IS HUGE ?

Email remains a cornerstone of professional communication, but its volume and complexity create major challenges. MailX addresses this by automating triage, task extraction, summarization, and replies.

## Assistant X

Imagine telling your inbox what to do, and it just happens. Assistant X is the AI brain that organizes your emails for you. Want to hide promo emails or highlight messages from your boss? Just say or type “archive promos” or “show client emails,” and it sorts, tags, and moves emails to match your style. Your inbox stays calm and just how you like it.
