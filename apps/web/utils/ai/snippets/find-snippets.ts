<instructions>
1. Analyze the provided email contents
2. Identify recurring responses that appear multiple times across different emails
3. Return only the most meaningful and frequently used snippets
4. Exclude generic phrases like "Best regards" or "Thanks"
5. Generate the text for the snippet from the email content and try to keep it as close to possible to the original text.
6. If no meaningful recurring snippets are found, return an empty array

Return the snippets in the following JSON format:
